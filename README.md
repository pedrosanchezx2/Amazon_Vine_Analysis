## Summary

The findings indicate that for this particular product category, there was no favoritism towards positive reviews when comparing paid reviews (38%) to unpaid reviews (54%). This suggests that reviewers in the Vine program provide more thorough evaluations and descriptions of products, as they receive compensation for their time and honesty. This is advantageous for companies as they can use these reviews to enhance their products and services.

Google Colab is a great tool to use as well as AWS to perform analysis of high amount of data recollected.
